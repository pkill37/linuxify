# linuxify

Transparently transform the macOS CLI into a fresh GNU/Linux CLI experience by

- installing missing GNU programs
- updating outdated GNU programs
- replacing pre-installed BSD programs with their preferred GNU implementation
- installing other programs common among popular GNU/Linux distributions

You should review the script, but if you want to go back you can uninstall just
as easily as the install.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nateProjects/linuxify.git
cd linuxify/
./linuxify install
```

## Uninstall

```bash
./linuxify uninstall
```
